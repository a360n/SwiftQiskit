# SwiftQiskit 

**SwiftQiskit** is an open-source, GUI-first Quantum Computing SDK written in pure Swift, inspired by IBM's Qiskit.

Unlike traditional quantum frameworks that rely on CLI tools and notebooks, SwiftQiskit focuses on **visual interaction**, **native SwiftUI integration**, and **developer-friendly APIs** for Apple platforms.

---

## ✨ Key Goals

- Provide a **pure Swift** quantum circuit simulator
- Offer a **visual-first (GUI)** quantum computing experience
- Make quantum concepts more accessible for students and developers
- Enable iOS / macOS quantum education apps

---

##  Project Scope (v1.0)

- Statevector-based quantum simulation
- Core quantum gates (H, X, Z, CNOT)
- Simple quantum circuit API
- Measurement and probability visualization
- Native SwiftUI GUI components

>  This project is a simulator, not a real quantum hardware backend.

---

##  Inspired By

- IBM Qiskit (Python)
- Quantum Computing Textbook
- Visual quantum circuit composers

---

##  Current Status

 **Project initialized**  
This repository is under active development.  
Core implementation will be added incrementally with frequent commits.

---

##  Roadmap (Short)

- [ ] Core math (Complex numbers, matrices)
- [ ] Quantum state representation
- [ ] Basic quantum gates
- [ ] Circuit model
- [ ] GUI canvas (SwiftUI)
- [ ] Example app
